# Information
#### About
Pandora is an open-source Growtopia Trainer designed with quality in mind. Code might be messy! This project was mainly for practice with Memory and overall C#.
If you wish to contribute and are in the discord, you will get a "Contributor" role. I am very thankful for everyone contributing.

#### Opcodes
Opcodes are always welcome to the project! If you have any, I probably wont purchase any due to them becoming outdated in weeks after purchase.
Pasting shit here isn't that appreciated, however, i frankly do not care. If you are pasting, i suggest you tell where the opcodes came from or then make a private fork of the project.

# FAQ
### Why is this open-source?
Its to prevent idiots from placing stealers in "trainers" to make profit, etc. It is also open source because i want more people to learn about this kind of stuff and make trainers for themselves. People think its hard, its not hard and its actually really simple! I hope people can learn from this project and make stuff themselves.

### What can i do with the code?
##### You can:
Modify it to your liking
Modify the design or overall code of the trainer
Release your modified version of it

##### You cannot:
Make profit with it
Remove all credits regarding the original creator
Market Pandora as yours or copy this code and claim it is yours
Use the code in stealers or bind Pandora to your stealers
Add malware to your modifications of Pandora
